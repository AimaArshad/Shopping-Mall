🔦 This project was a pivotal learning experience for both of us, refining our skills in database design, Windows Forms for UI development, and backend operations using C#. Managing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) effectively within a desktop application was particularly rewarding.

 From writing code to debugging errors, seeing our project come to life was incredibly fulfilling.


  Looking forward to applying these skills to more challenging projects in the future!
